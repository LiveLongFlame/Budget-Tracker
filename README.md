# Budget-Tracker
Welcome the Budget-Tracker. A Website where you can upload your own csv files and will return information on to the webpage such as total spent and the different catogories that was spent , income etc.

The program is still in development so there still be bugs. 
Further csv MUST be sorted by Date,Description,Debit,Credit,Balance,Category,SubCategory*(optional). 
Any other order and the program will not work




Please enjoy my program :) 

P.S: To run the program run node app.js
