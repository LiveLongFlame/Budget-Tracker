# Budget-Tracker
Welcome the Budget-Tracker. A Website where you can upload your own csv files and will return information on to the webpage such as total spent and the different catogories that was spent. 

The main frame work of this project is run in node.js so in order to use the program must intall node.js before use.

The program is still in development so there still be bugs. 
Further csv MUST be sorted by Date,Description,Debit,Credit,Balance,Category,SubCategory. 
Any other order and the program will not work


Please enjoy my program :)
